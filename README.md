### OTel is NOT

OpenTelemetry is not an observability solution by itself. It is a data collection standard. The data collected by OTel still needs to be sent to an observability vendor in order to get dashboards, alerts, etc. from your data.

# The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)

The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) specification describes the encoding, transport, and delivery mechanism of telemetry data between telemetry sources, intermediate nodes such as collectors and telemetry backends.
